Rick's Python Config
=====================

I'm a Python web dev so lots of tweaks for that.

I've recently done some heavy lifting to get it pathogen compatible so give me a
bit to settle the dust while I finish cleaning/updating docs/testing things
out.

Install
--------
Setup is handled by `install.py` which will do the symlinks, install the
plugins, and copy them over to the `.vim/bundle` directory.

ToDo
----
- need pylint or pyflakes preferably with highlighting in the page via spell 
- need an upgrade script command to walk through the plugins and pull updates
